# Project---SecureGitEntry
# Day27 of 30 days 30 projects challenge

Welcome to SecureGitEntry â€“ your simple and secure GitHub login page.


## What is SecureGitEntry?
It's just a straightforward webpage made for logging into your GitHub account. No extra stuff, just login simplicity.


## How it Works
Just type in your GitHub username and password, and that's it! It's all happening on the webpage itself, no fancy server things.


## What I Used
Fonts: Poppins, Roboto
Colors: Inspired by the dark GitHub theme â€“ because who doesn't love a bit of coding in the dark?


Feel free to use this for your GitHub login needs ðŸš€

Feel free to adjust it further as needed!
